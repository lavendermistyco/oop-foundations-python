# OOP Foundations (Python) â€” Class, Object, Attributes, `__init__`

This repository accompanies an introductory lesson on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.  
It includes runnable code examples, lightweight tests, and UML class diagrams (PlantUML) for reference.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

1. Install **VS Code** and **Python 3.12.2**.  
2. Open a **Bash terminal** in VS Code.
3. Fork the repo:
   ```bash
      https://github.com/lavendermistyco/oop-foundations-python.git
   ```
5. Clone your forked repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/oop-foundations-python.git
   cd oop-foundations-python/oop-foundations-student
   ```
6. Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   py -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate     # (Git Bash)
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # (PowerShell)

   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
7. Install packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

## ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Learn
- Define classes and instantiate objects  
- Use instance attributes and methods  
- Understand and use the `__init__` constructor  
- Read simple UML class diagrams and translate them to code

â”œâ”€â”€ examples
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ car.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ student.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bank_account.py   # scaffolded for you to complete
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ library           # breakout UML activity (not code)

```

## ðŸ§ª Running Code and Tests
- Run examples:  
  ```bash
  python examples/car.py
  python examples/student.py
  ```
- Run all tests:  
  ```bash
  python -m pytest -q
  ```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Breakout Assignments
- `examples/library/` contains **class stubs only** â€” these are for UML breakout activities, not pre-written solutions.  
- **BankAccount** is your applied coding exercise. It is scaffolded and should be implemented to make the tests pass.
